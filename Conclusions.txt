With Mumbai, Jaipur and Hyderabad in the bottom positions.
Bangalore is the top city by no of transaction and Hyderabad the bottom city. This matches with Revenues from above
In the final query, Kolkata is the top performer by sales in January and November, and Bangalore in September and October. 
But Hyderabad is an underperformer for almost all months, root cause analysis needs to be conducted for Hyderabad.
